Overview:

On Day 7, the focus shifts to deploying the project live and ensuring it’s ready for the public. After the deployment,
post-launch practices are discussed to maintain smooth operations and ongoing improvements.

Features:

Deploy the project to a cloud platform for public access (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS).
Set up environment variables for the production environment.
Implement basic monitoring and logging tools to track errors.
Collect initial user feedback.
Optimize performance for faster loading times.
Set up SEO and analytics tracking.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: [e.g., Next.js, React]
Backend: [e.g., Node.js, Express.js, Sanity]
Cloud Platform: [e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS]
Tools: TypeScript, Git, VS Code

Objectives:

Deploy the project to a cloud platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS).
Set up production environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
Implement monitoring tools for application health (e.g., Sentry for error tracking, Google Analytics).
Test the deployment for functionality on different devices and browsers.
Implement basic SEO strategies (e.g., meta tags, sitemap generation).
Conduct load testing to verify the platform’s traffic-handling capacity.
Plan for regular updates and bug fixes post-launch.

Installation:

To deploy the project live:

1. Set up a GitHub repository (if not already done).
2. Link the repository to the cloud platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS).
3. Push the latest changes to the repository.
4. Configure the necessary production environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in the cloud platform dashboard.
5. Deploy the project and monitor the process for any deployment errors.
6. Confirm that the application runs smoothly in the production environment.

To manage post-launch practices:

Monitor Performance: Ensure the app runs smoothly, checking for any issues or errors.
Collect Feedback: Gather initial feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.
Optimize Regularly: Continuously improve loading times and address any performance bottlenecks.
Update Content: Regularly push content updates and bug fixes.

Conclusion:

Live deployment and post-launch practices are crucial for maintaining the stability, optimization, and user-friendliness of the platform. 
                               By consistently monitoring performance, gathering feedback, and making regular improvements,
                               the marketplace can scale effectively and provide a seamless experience to users.
