Overview
On Day 3, the focus is on API integration and data migration to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend. Additionally,
data from existing systems will be transferred to the Furniture & Crockery Marketplace securely and efficiently.

Objectives
✅ Integrate APIs for smooth data exchange between frontend and backend.
✅ Migrate existing data without errors to the new platform.
✅ Enhance security and performance for scalable marketplace operations.

API Integration
Backend Setup
Defined API endpoints for key functionalities:

🔐 User Authentication: Login, signup, password reset.
🏺 Product Management: Add, update, delete, and list products.
🛒 Order Processing: Create, update, and retrieve orders.
Implemented these endpoints using Next.js API Routes.
✅ Tested API endpoints using Postman or Thunder Client for reliability.

Frontend Integration
Connected frontend components to the backend using Axios.
Handled API responses effectively:

🔄 Show loading states while fetching data.
⚠️ Display error messages for failed requests.
📡 Update UI dynamically based on API responses.
Security Enhancements
🔑 Implemented JWT-based authentication for secure user login.
🔒 Used HTTPS for encrypted communication.

Data Migration
Planning the Migration
🗂 Listed all data entities to be migrated:

Users (Customer accounts)
Products (Furniture & crockery inventory)
Orders (Purchase history)
📝 Mapped old database fields to the new schema for smooth transition.

Data Extraction
📥 Exported data from the previous database in CSV or JSON format.
🔧 Used database-specific tools for extraction.

Data Transformation
🧹 Cleaned and formatted data to match the new database structure.
❗ Handled missing or duplicate records.

Data Loading
📤 Imported processed data into the new database (MongoDB/Firebase).
✅ Ran validation tests to confirm data integrity.

Notes
⚠ Error Handling: Implemented logs to track errors during API calls and migration.
📊 Testing: Verified all API endpoints and checked data consistency post-migration.
🔐 Security: Used encryption for data transfer and secured passwords.

Conclusion
Integrating APIs ensures smooth interaction between the user interface and backend, while data migration guarantees a solid start for the marketplace.
These are critical steps in building a scalable and user-friendly platform.
